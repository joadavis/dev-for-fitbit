# dev-for-fitbit
Developing apps and watch faces for the Fitbit line of smart watches and fitness trackers

Repository structure will have a directory for watch faces.
 - SUSE-love is the first attempt at making a watch face using the SUSE "Geeko" chameleon
 - SUSE-2020 is a refreshed design using the latest logo and design guidelines

If you find that a watch face directory is (nearly) empty, look for a corresponding .zip file in the watch-faces/archives.

Another directory will contain applications (such as games) for smart watches.
